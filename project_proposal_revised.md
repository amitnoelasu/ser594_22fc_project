**Keywords**: Score prediction, Personality, Natural Language Processing

**Description**: This project is aimed at observing patterns in the tweet data of a person and predicting how they would score on the Big 5 personality test. To train a the predicting model, a dataset of celebrities with their Big 5 scores will be used. Then their tweets would be scraped from twitter and correlations will be made between their lexical usage and each of their personality traits' score.

**Research Questions**:
1. To describe trends in the lexical usage of twitter users picked randomly
2. To predict the value of each of the BIG 5 personality traits for a particula user
3. To defend the model for performing prediction of scores for each of those 5 traits
4. To analayze the model for potential gaps in its ability to predict correctly


**Intellectual Merit**: To find out if using tweet data is a reliable way to identify personality markers

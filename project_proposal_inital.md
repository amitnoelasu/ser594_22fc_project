**Keywords**: Image classification, Psychological classification, Natural Language Processing

**Description**: This project is aimed at observing patterns in the digital behavior of an individual and linking them to the answers in the Big 5 personality test. Answering these questions with reasonable accuracy produces a comprehensive personality assessment of the individual. The digital data would mainly be text and image data from social media. Based on the assessment, some interesting questions that can be answered are as follows:
1. What kind of careers are suitable for that individual?
2. What are the key habits employed by such an individual?
3. What kind of advertisements/recommendations can be shown/made to that individual?


The feasibility of this project can depend on several factors such as the availability and quality of data reflecting the life of the individual. Most importantly, it depends on the strategy employed to link digital behavior data to survey answers.

**Intellectual Merit**: To find out if the results produced by the experiment reflect the ground truth, which is to see if the experiment is a reliable way to identify personality markers. 

**Data Sourcing**: The image and text data can be scraped from twitter either using web scraping libraries or accessed directly using Twitter Data API

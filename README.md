# ser594_22fc_project
This repository contains files for the individual course project in SER594: Data Science for Software Engineers (fall 2022) created by AMIT NOEL THOKALA for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.  At this time, this project has not been cleared by the course staff (R. Acuna, V. Gupta) for public release, and must be kept within a private repository.
